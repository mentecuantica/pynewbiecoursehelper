# Introduction to Python: Basic Syntax, Data Types, Variables, and Control Flow
## 1. Python Syntax, Operators, and Variables
Python has simple and clean syntax. Here are some of the fundamental aspects of Python:

### Comments
Comments are used to make code more readable and document its functionality. Python supports two types of comments:

Single-line comments start with #:
```Python
# This is a single-line comment.
Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or '''):
```

```Python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
Useful for providing detailed explanations.
"""
```
### Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that Python evaluates to a single value.

```Python
# Example of simple arithmetic expressions:
result = 2 + 2
complex_result = 10 * (2 + 3) / 5
```
### Assignment Operator (=)
The = operator assigns the result of an expression to a variable.

```Python
name = "Python Learner"
score = 100
```
### Variable Names
Variable names:

Are case-sensitive.
Must start with a letter or an underscore (_), not a number.
Cannot contain special characters or spaces.
Valid examples:

```Python
my_var = 10
_user = "John"
```
Invalid examples:

```Python
1name = "Invalid"  # Variable name cannot start with a digit.
var-1 = 50         # Special characters like '-' are not allowed.
```

## 2. Basic Data Types
### 1. int (Integer)
Whole numbers.

```Python
age = 25
```
### 2. float (Floating-Point Number)
Numbers with decimal points.

```Python
pi = 3.14159
```
### 3. str (String)
A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

```
greeting = "Hello, World!"
```
### 4. bool (Boolean)
Logical values: True or False.

```
is_active = True
```

## 3. Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Floor Division (//)
Modulus (%)
Exponentiation (**)

Example:

```Python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a ** b  # 5^3 = 125
```
## Logical Operators
and: Returns True if both conditions are true.
or: Returns True if at least one condition is true.
not: Negates a boolean value.
Example:

```Python
age = 20
if age > 18 and age < 30:
    print("You are young!")
```

### 4. Control Flow: Conditional Statements

If-Else Statements
Control the flow of your program based on conditions.

```Python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```
Elif
Allows checking multiple conditions.

```Python
marks = 85
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")
```
##  5. Loops
### For Loop
Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string, range).

```Python
for i in range(1, 5):  # Outputs 1, 2, 3, 4
    print(i)
```
### While Loop
Repeats as long as a condition is true.

```Python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
## 6. Functions
Functions help encapsulate reusable logic.

```Python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### Function call
```Python
print(greet("Alice"))
```

## 7. Common Errors in Python
SyntaxError
Occurs due to incorrect syntax.

```Python
# Missing a colon in the if statement:
if age > 18
    print("Adult")
```
### NameError
Occurs when using a variable before defining it.

```Python
print(x)  # x is not defined
```
### IndexError
Occurs when accessing a non-existent index in a list.

```Python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[5])  # Index out of range
```
### ZeroDivisionError
Occurs when dividing by zero.

```Python
result = 1 / 0  # Division by zero
```

## 8. Built-in Functions for Beginners
### len()
Returns the length of a collection or string.

```Python
print(len("Python"))  # Output: 6
type()
```
Returns the type of a variable.

```Python
print(type(42))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```
### str(), int(), float()
Convert between types.

```Python
number = int("42")  # Converts string to integer
```
