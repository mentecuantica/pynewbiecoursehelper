# Lists, Indexing, Tuples, and Sets in Python

Python provides various data structures to store and manipulate collections of data. Here's an overview of lists, tuples, and sets.

---

## 1. Lists
A **list** is an ordered and mutable collection of elements. Lists can contain items of any data type, including other lists.

### Creating a List
```python
# Creating lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "Python", True, 3.14]
nested = [1, [2, 3], 4]
```


### Accessing List Items
You can access list items using their index. Python uses zero-based indexing.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 10
print(numbers[-1])  # Output: 40 (last item)
```

### Modifying Lists
Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.

```
numbers[1] = 99  # Changes the second element to 99
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 99, 30, 40]
```

### Common List Operations
#### Append: Add an item to the end.

```python
numbers.append(50)  # Adds 50
```
Insert: Add an item at a specific index.
```python
numbers.insert(1, 15)  # Adds 15 at index 1
```
#### Remove: Remove a specific item.
```python
numbers.remove(30)  # Removes the first occurrence of 30
```
#### Pop: Remove an item by index.
```python
last_item = numbers.pop()  # Removes and returns the last item
```
Sort: Arrange items in ascending or descending order.
```python
numbers.sort()  # Sorts in ascending order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)  # Descending order
```
## 2. Indexing and Slicing
Lists and other ordered collections support indexing and slicing.

### Indexing
Positive indices: Count from the beginning (0, 1, 2, ...).
Negative indices: Count from the end (-1, -2, -3, ...).

```Python
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(letters[1])   # Output: "b"
print(letters[-1])  # Output: "d"
```
Slicing
Slicing creates a sublist by specifying a range.

```
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
print(letters[1:4])  # Output: ["b", "c", "d"]
print(letters[:3])   # Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
print(letters[2:])   # Output: ["c", "d", "e"]
```
### 3. Tuples
A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items. Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements in a tuple.

#### Creating a Tuple
```Python
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
mixed = (1, "Python", 3.14)
singleton = (42,)  # A single-item tuple requires a trailing comma
```
#### Accessing Tuple Elements
Tuples support indexing and slicing, just like lists.

```Python
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1
print(numbers[-1])  # Output: 3
```
### Why Use Tuples?
Tuples are faster than lists.
Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries (lists cannot because they are mutable).
Tuples are ideal for storing fixed collections of data, such as coordinates (x, y).
## 4. Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique items. Sets are mutable but cannot contain duplicate values.

### Creating a Set
```Python
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
empty_set = set()  # Creates an empty set
```

### Set Characteristics
Items are unordered, so you cannot access them using an index.
Duplicate items are automatically removed.

```Python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```
## Common Set Operations
### Add an element:

```Python
numbers.add(5)  # Adds 5 to the set
```

### Remove an element:
```Python
numbers.remove(3)  # Removes 3
```
### Set union:
```Python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
print(set1 | set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Set intersection:

```Python
print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3}
```
Set difference:
```Python 
print(set1 - set2)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

## 5. Comparison of Lists, Tuples, and Sets

| Feature            | List       | Tuple      | Set         |
|---------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Ordered**         | Yes        | Yes        | No          |
| **Mutable**         | Yes        | No         | Yes         |
| **Duplicates**      | Allowed    | Allowed    | Not allowed |
| **Indexable**       | Yes        | Yes        | No          |


These data structures form the foundation of Python programming and are used in various real-world applications, such as data processing, machine learning, and web development.
